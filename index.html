                Michael Gary Scott was born on March 15, 1965 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be "two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.
In the episode "Take Your Daughter to Work Day", Michael makes the claim that he was a child star on a kids' show called Fundle Bundle; however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of many guest children. In the old recording being played, he speaks touchingly about what he wanted when he grew up: get married, have "100 kids" so he could then have "100 friends" and none of them could say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost all his tuition money in a pyramid scheme.Michael started at Dunder Mifflin as a salesman in the 1990s. He tends to overestimate his own importance in the eyes of his coworkers and cannot understand why they do not share his enthusiasm. Michael believes an office should be the "place where dreams come true."
He is loyal to the company and honestly tries to help his employees when he thinks they are having a problem. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as of "Michael's Last Dundies") 9,986,000 minutes, which means that he has been working there since May 6, 1992.

							Jim has two brothers; Pete, who lives in Boston, and Tom, who lives in New Jersey. They are both characterized as sharing Jim's general love of pranks but have come across as unpleasant and they somewhat bully their little brother.Jim is a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Eagles, and the Philadelphia 76ers. Jim appears to be a fan of hip-hop, specifically Eminem.Though Jim loves to play pranks on Dwight, he is shown to have some things in common with his nemesis, such as a knowledge of comic books and an appreciation for the sci-fi/fantasy genre.A major part of Jim Halpert's character is his relationship with Pam Beesly, which is often the subject of office speculation. This is made worse by the fact that Pam was engaged to Roy Anderson, a Dunder Mifflin warehouse worker.

								<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
								When the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight formally held the title of "Assistant to the Regional Manager", but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott. (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in "The Fight", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the "title change only", then never acknowledges it again.) Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him. Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and naïve. For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert. Dwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations. At the office, his most recurring business wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved shirt, with a dark necktie and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.
